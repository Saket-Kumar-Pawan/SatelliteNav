Collision Avoidance System: Design and implement a collision avoidance system using Java. Integrate orbital data from public satellite databases (fake databse which is generated randomly in MySQL)and develop algorithms to predict potential collisions with space debris or other satellites. Implement automated maneuver generation to mitigate collision risks.
design with the user input fields and provide the output using the different buttons for the different operations.
